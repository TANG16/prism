Prism: Multiple spline regression with regularization, dimensionality reduction, and feature selection
====

# Summary
Prism uses a combination of statistical methods to conduct spline-based multiple regression. Prism conducts this regression using regularization, dimensionality reduction, and feature selection, through a combination of smoothing spline regression, PCA, and RVR/LASSO.

Prism has been tested in MATLAB 2015b and requires three first-party toolboxes: (1) Curve Fitting Toolbox; (2) Statistics and Machine Learning Toolbox; (3) Signal Processing Toolbox. Relevance Vector Regression (RVR) requires the SparseBayes V2 toolbox, which can be obtained from http://www.relevancevector.com.

# Usage

See `demo.m` for an outline of the implementation.

% Demo of Prism functionality

%% init
% import prism
addpath(fullfile('..','prism'))

% load demo data
load('demo')
% demo contains four variables:
%
% tr_X and tr_y are our training data
% te_X and te_y are our test data
%
% tr data has 500 cases, te data has 100 cases
% X has 175 predictors

%% Train

% clear opt, in case it has any previous values
clear opt
% some warnings 'commonly' occur
%       I don't want disabling these to be the default
%       but, also are not a problem in most cases 
%       (won't be best model anyway)
% so let's disable them with the options
opt.disableWarnings = 1;

% force least-squares spline, often reduces over-fitting
opt.spline.p        = 0;

% options to experiment with:
%opt.doSpline        = 0;
%opt.doPCA           = 0;
%opt.doRVR           = 0;

% fit prism to training data
mdl     = prism_train(tr_X,tr_y,opt);
% get performance metrics
% is an estimate of best-case of sorts:
%       poor performance here is a bad sign
%       but, good performance could represent over-fitting
tr_perf = prism_eval(tr_y,mdl)

% results with spline.p=0
% mdl performance (tr_perf) should be approx:
%       r2 = .77; MdAE = 6.40

%% Test

% apply model from training data to test data
% mdl.pred here is y_hat
fit     = prism_test(te_X,mdl);
% measure model performance, i.e., the whole point of this
te_perf = prism_eval(te_y,fit)

% fit performance (te_perf) should be approx:
%       r2 = .78; MdAE = 7.75

% visualize predictions in test data

# Example implementation

To provide an example of Prism's implementation, see the 'demo' folder. `demo.mat` was generated using brain morphology data, where each column corresponds to a brain morphology measure. The test and training data are derived from independent MR sites, and the dependent variable is age. The data is from an unpublished study and the pre-processing pipeline is not finalized (e.g., correcting for site effects), so further information of the dataset is not provided at this time.

# Benchmark

As a benchmark, `demo.m` was run using several configurations: (1) RVR (default) or LASSO for the multiple regression; (2) with or without PCA; and (3) with or without spline regression--yielding eight comparison analyses. A 'constant' model, where all ages are simply predicted to be the mean age (within the testing dataset) was also included as an upper-limit of performance (i.e., a good model should do no worse than this).

Here I ran each analyses 100 times and report several measures of performance: R<sup>2</sup> and median absolute error (MdAE) in the testing data, average time to compute (all run on the same machine), and stability of error performance (SD of MdAE across the 100 calculations). All analyses were run with least-squares splines (`opt.spline.p=0`).


Model variant              |  R<sup>2</sup>  |  MdAE  | Time [s] | SD(MdAE)
-------------------------- | ----: | -----: | -------: | -------:
Spline+PCA+RVR             |  .777 |  7.74  |    0.55  |   0    
(Prism default)            |       |        |          |         
                           |       |        |          |
Spline+PCA+LASSO           |  .779 |  8.06  |    3.84  |   0.17      
Spline+RVR                 |  .758 |  8.42  |    1.26  |   0      
Spline+LASSO               |  .776 |  8.35  |  232.84  |   0.05      
PCA+RVR                    |  .601 | 12.31  |    0.12  |   0      
PCA+LASSO                  |  .713 |  9.66  |    2.54  |   0.11      
RVR                        |  .703 | 10.57  |    0.12  |   0      
LASSO                      |  .777 |  8.53  |  231.43  |   0.04
                           |       |        |          |
Constant [y_hat = Mean(y)] |  .000 | 22.28  |          |


The above benchmarks suggest that, given the `demo.mat` training and test data, spline-based regression leads to substantially better predictions, particularly in the case of the median absolute error (MdAE). When splines are not used, LASSO performs better than RVR, but comes with a much larger computational cost. This computational cost can be largely mitigated through the use of PCA for dimensionality reduction, but even otherwise, PCA is associated with a marked improvement in prediction performance. We also see that given this dataset, regression models using LASSO (as opposed to RVR), are nondeterministic (i.e., there is variability in the performance of the model across each time it is run ), as SD(MdAE)>0.
